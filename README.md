## Introduction
This project is a **Malware Detection System** that scans files for potential malware threats using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various features of files, including size, entropy, and metadata, to predict whether a file is malware or clean.

## Features
- **File Analysis:** Analyzes file properties such as size, entropy, and extension.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a trained model for accurate malware detection.
- **Scalability:** Can scan directories recursively for multiple files.
- **User-friendly:** Simple command-line interface for scanning files.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection.git
   cd malware-detection

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Download the model and scaler:**
   - Ensure you have the trained model (malware_detection_model_selected_features.pkl) and scaler (scaler_selected_features.pkl) in the project directory.
  
## usage
**To scan a directory for malware, run the following command in your terminal:**
   python malware_detection.py

## Example

     Enter the directory path to scan for malware: ./my_test_directory
The system will analyze all files in the specified directory and report any malware detected. You will see output similar to this:

     Malware detected: ./my_test_directory/malicious_file.exe
     Clean file: ./my_test_directory/clean_file.txt
